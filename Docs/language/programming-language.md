| They do not provide many facilities at the hardware level.	| They are very close to the hardware and help to write a program at the hardware level.|
| For writing programs, hardware knowledge is not required.	| For writing programs, hardware knowledge is a must.|
| The programs are easy to modify.	| Modifying programs is difficult.|
