# Programming Language
### Level
Programming Languages are broadly classified into two type
| High-Level | Low-Level |
|---|--|
| close to the human | close to the hardware |
| High-Level Languages are easy to learn and understand. | Low-Level Languages are challenging to learn and understand. 
| They are executed slower than lower level languages because they require a translator program.	| They execute with high speed.|
| They do not provide many facilities at the hardware level.	| They are very close to the hardware and help to write a program at the hardware level.|
| For writing programs, hardware knowledge is not required.	| For writing programs, hardware knowledge is a must.|
| The programs are easy to modify.	| Modifying programs is difficult.|
| A single statement may execute several instructions.	| The statements can be directly mapped to processor instructions.|
| BASIC, Perl, Pascal, COBOL, Ruby etc are examples of High-Level Languages.	| Machine language and Assembly language are Low-Level Languages.|

### 타이핑(typing)
| 강 타입 | 약 타입 |
|---|--|
| 자료형 정적 | 자료형 동적 |
| 자료형을 명시해야하기 때문에 약 타입 보다 제한적 | 자유롭게 개발가능 |
| 컴파일 단계에서 문제 확인 가능 | 실행 하기전까지 확인 불가 |
| 일반적으로 상용화하는 툴에 적합, 안전성 높음 | 타입 변경에 따른 의도가 명확하지 않을 수 있음(문자->숫자), 오류 발생률 높음 |
| C, C++, C#, Java | javascript |
